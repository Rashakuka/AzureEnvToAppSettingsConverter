# AzureEnvToAppSettingsConverter
This tool converts Azure Web App environment variables (in JSON format) to the traditional ASP.NET appSettings.config XML format. It's particularly useful when migrating applications from Azure Web Apps to on-premises deployments or when you need to maintain configuration files in the classic ASP.NET format.
